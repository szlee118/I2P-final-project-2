# I2P-final-roject-2

A  game like feeding frenzy using allegro  

This is a code-blocks project.  
To download codeblocks:https://www.allegro.cc/files/     
(in the project I use window binaries package MinGW 4.7.0 )   

Allegro should be downloaded from:  
https://www.allegro.cc/files/  

This project can run directly after cloning only with  
putting allegro-5.0.10-mingw-4.7.0(uncompressed from zip) under the same directory as final.cbp
